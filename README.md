# 🎨 Random Avatar Generator

## 🚀 **About This Project**

So, I was bored one day, and I thought, *"Why not build something fun and simple?"* And voilà! This **Random Avatar Generator** was born! 🎉

It's a Flutter app that lets you create random avatars by mixing and matching different facial features like face shapes, hairstyles, eyes, mouths, noses, ears, beards, glasses, and accessories. You can also customize each feature manually or let the app surprise you with a completely random avatar! 🎲
